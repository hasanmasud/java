/**
 * A small frog wants to get to the other side of a river. The frog is currently
 * located at position 0, and wants to get to position X. Leaves fall from a
 * tree onto the surface of the river.
 * 
 * You are given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers
 * representing the falling leaves. A[K] represents the position where one leaf
 * falls at time K, measured in seconds.
 * 
 * The goal is to find the earliest time when the frog can jump to the other
 * side of the river. The frog can cross only when leaves appear at every
 * position across the river from 1 to X. You may assume that the speed of the
 * current in the river is negligibly small, i.e. the leaves do not change their
 * positions once they fall in the river.
 * 
 * For example, you are given integer X = 5 and array A such that:
 * 
 * A[0] = 1 A[1] = 3 A[2] = 1 A[3] = 4 A[4] = 2 A[5] = 3 A[6] = 5 A[7] = 4 In
 * second 6, a leaf falls into position 5. This is the earliest time when leaves
 * appear in every position across the river.
 * 
 * Write a function:
 * 
 * class Solution { public int solution(int X, int[] A); }
 * 
 * that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers and
 * integer X, returns the earliest time when the frog can jump to the other side
 * of the river.
 * 
 * If the frog is never able to jump to the other side of the river, the
 * function should return âˆ’1.
 * 
 * For example, given X = 5 and array A such that:
 * 
 * A[0] = 1 A[1] = 3 A[2] = 1 A[3] = 4 A[4] = 2 A[5] = 3 A[6] = 5 A[7] = 4 the
 * function should return 6, as explained above.
 * 
 * Assume that:
 * 
 * N and X are integers within the range [1..100,000]; each element of array A
 * is an integer within the range [1..X]. Complexity:
 * 
 * expected worst-case time complexity is O(N); expected worst-case space
 * complexity is O(X), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required
 * for input arguments). Elements of input arrays can be modified.
